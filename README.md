# Assesment Management System

The Assessment Management System is a web application designed to manage assessments, including creating, editing, and grading assessments. This system is built using React.js for the front end, Spring Boot for the back end, and MySQL for the database.


## Features

- User Authentication: Secure user authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage assessments.
- Assessment Creation: Create assessments with various types of questions such as multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions.
- Assessment Editing: Edit existing assessments, add or remove questions, and update assessment details.
- Grading System: Implement a grading system for assessments, allowing instructors to grade student responses and provide feedback.
- User Roles: Differentiate between roles such as admin, instructor, and student, each with specific permissions.
- Dashboard: Provide a user-friendly dashboard for users to view their assessments, grades, and other relevant information.


## Technology Used

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- Spring Boot: A Java-based framework for building scalable and secure web applications.

- MySQL: A relational database management system for storing assessment data.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
